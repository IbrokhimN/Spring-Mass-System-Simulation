# Spring-Mass System Simulation

This Python program simulates a spring-mass-damper system using Matplotlib for visualization and SciPy for solving the differential equations governing the motion. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for dynamically adjusting parameters and observing their impact on the system in real-time.
Features
Physics Simulation

    Simulates the motion of a mass-spring-damper system under gravity using the equation:
    
    x¨=g−kxm−bx˙m
    x¨=g−mkx​−mbx˙​ where:
        xx: displacement
        kk: spring stiffness
        mm: mass
        bb: damping coefficient
        gg: gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)

Interactive GUI

    Dynamically update the following parameters:
    
        Spring Stiffness (k)
        Mass (m)
        Damping Coefficient (b)
        Maximum Stretch (x_max)
        
    Text boxes allow real-time updates, with the animation adjusting instantly.

Animation

    Visualizes:
    
        The spring stretching/compressing.
        The mass (as a blue square) moving up and down.
        A red spring color when the spring breaks due to excessive force/stretch.

Requirements

    Python 3.7 or above
    Required libraries:
    
        Matplotlib: for animation and GUI elements.
        NumPy: for numerical computations.
        SciPy: for solving differential equations.

Installation

    Clone the repository or download the script:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/spring-mass-system.git
cd spring-mass-system

Install the required libraries:

    pip install matplotlib scipy numpy

How to Run

    Execute the script:

    python spring_mass_simulation.py

    Use the GUI to adjust parameters and observe changes in real-time.

Components
1. Differential Equation Solver

    Uses solve_ivp from SciPy to solve the second-order ODE for the spring-mass-damper system.

2. Visualization

    Matplotlib:
        FuncAnimation animates the spring and mass motion.
        TextBox widgets allow parameter adjustments during runtime.
        A dynamic spring and mass visualization with collision detection at the ground level.

3. Spring Break Condition

    Spring turns red and the simulation halts when:
        The force exceeds kmax×xmaxkmax​×xmax​.
        The stretch exceeds the maximum allowable length (xmaxxmax​).



Usage Example

    Set Initial Parameters:
        Stiffness: 100 N/m
        Mass: 1 kg
        Damping Coefficient: 0.25 kg/s
        Maximum Stretch: 1 m
    Visualize System Behavior:
        The spring stretches and compresses based on physical forces.
        Update parameters like stiffness or damping to see how the system's behavior changes.
